    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Haven-Kings Property Management, overseeing a vast portfolio of houses in the King County area, faces a dynamic and competitive real estate market. It's undeniable that Seattle and, by extension, King County stand as prime locations for acquiring and overseeing rental assets. Savvy investors understand that while a single property in this thriving market is beneficial, expanding one's real estate holdings is the key to amplifying profits and securing long-term financial stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, improper strategy can lead to an accumulation of properties that fail to generate revenue. A fruitful investment in real estate is not just an assortment of various properties; it must be a well-thought-out portfolio that not only yields income but also capitalizes on tax benefits. Otherwise, these so-called \"investments\" can quickly become costly burdens. Property managers, real estate agents, and individual property owners need to set the right pricing to maximize their returns while staying competitive. The challenge is to find the optimal balance between high rental or sales prices and market demand. This is where data-driven insights can make a significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Haven-Kings Property Management is our client, overseeing a vast portfolio of houses in King County, and they aim to optimize their rental pricing strategy. Haven-Kings has previously relied on traditional methods of setting rent and pricing for their investors. They have been dependent on Comparative Market Analysis (CMA), where they conduct local comparisons by looking at similar properties in the same area to gauge reasonable pricing. Another method they have relied on is the \"1% Rule\": The monthly rent/pricing should be approximately 1% of the property's total value. Additionally, they increase prices each year based on the rate of inflation or a fixed percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to revolutionize Haven-Kings Property Management's approach to house pricing. This will be achieved by developing a predictive model using data analytics, specifically linear regression and machine learning techniques, to provide dynamic pricing recommendations based on various property features. This initiative is not just a step but a leap towards maximizing revenue and maintaining a competitive edge in Seattle's ever-evolving real estate market. The implementation of a predictive model for rental pricing is a forward-looking initiative that will position Haven-Kings Property Management as an industry leader in adopting data-driven strategies.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To address the business problem and achieve the objectives, the following research questions can guide the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **House Pricing:**\n",
    "   - What are the key factors that most strongly influence house prices in the King County area?\n",
    "   - How do house characteristics (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, amenities) and location impact property values in this specific market?\n",
    "   - Can a predictive model accurately estimate house prices for \"Haven-Kings Property Management's\" portfolio?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Pricing Recommendations:**\n",
