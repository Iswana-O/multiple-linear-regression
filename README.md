# Data-Driven Revenue Maximization for Haven-Kings Property Management

## Project Overview

Haven-Kings Property Management seeks to revolutionize house pricing using predictive models based on property features. This initiative aims to maximize revenue and maintain a competitive edge in King County, Washington, using the Multiple Linear Regression technique with the help of the ScikitLearn library. Our team of four has delved deep into the dataset to gain insights, preprocess data, and build an effective regression model.

## Repository Navigation (To be edited to fit names of our final files)

- **Code:** The 'code' directory contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling. 
- **Data:** The 'data' directory includes the datasets used in the project.
- **Images:** This directory contains images and visualizations used in the presentation. *****
- **Presentation:** The 'presentation' directory contains our detailed project presentation.
- **README:** You are here!

## The Process
### 1. Dataset

The dataset, sourced from the KC House Data, includes features such as:

- `id` - Unique ID for each home sold
- `date` - Date of the home sale
- `price` - Price of each home sold
- `bedrooms` - Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms` - Number of bathrooms
- `sqft_living` - Square footage of the home
- ... and many more!

**Dependencies**

- Python 3.x
- ScikitLearn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

To install the necessary libraries, use the following:

```python
!pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### 2. Data Processing
We cleaned and prepared the data, handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation where necessary. This step ensured the dataset's quality and consistency.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
EDA involved analyzing the dataset's characteristics, visualizing trends, and identifying key factors influencing house prices.

### 4. Predictive Modeling (To be completed. Need to add a few visuals from analysis) *****
We employed multiple linear regression and machine learning techniques to build predictive models for:
- Optimizing house pricing
- Predicting renovation needs
- 
**Model Building**: Utilize ScikitLearn's Linear Regression to predict house prices. ****
**Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like R-squared, RMSE, etc. to evaluate the model's performance. *****

 ### 5. Conclusions and Recommendations ******





 ### 6. Presentation *****
Our findings and insights are summarized in a presentation that provides a comprehensive view of our data analysis and recommendations for Haven-Kings Property Management.
