# **Multiple Linear Regression Analysis using KC House Data**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze and predict house prices in King County, Washington, using the Multiple Linear Regression technique with the help of the ScikitLearn library. Our team of four has delved deep into the dataset to gain insights, preprocess data, and build an effective regression model.

## **Dataset**

The dataset, sourced from the KC House Data, includes features such as:

- `id` - Unique ID for each home sold
- `date` - Date of the home sale
- `price` - Price of each home sold
- `bedrooms` - Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms` - Number of bathrooms
- `sqft_living` - Square footage of the home
- ... and many more!

## **Steps Involved**

1. **Data Exploration**: Dive deep into the dataset to understand the various features and their relationships.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data integrity.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features if necessary and transform existing ones for better model performance.
4. **Model Building**: Utilize ScikitLearn's Linear Regression to predict house prices.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like R-squared, RMSE, etc. to evaluate the model's performance.
6. **Visualization**: Graphically represent data and regression results for better understanding and insights.

## **Dependencies**

- Python 3.x
- ScikitLearn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

To install the necessary libraries, use the following:

```python
!pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
